# Lex Fridman interview with Colin Angle

Technology alone doesn't equal a successful business, the robot created can needs to **clearly** deliver more end value to the user than what it costs.  

## Inferences

There is a trade off between complexity of research and practical usefulness of robots. Some tech is just ahead of it's time. Cutting edge technology being developed at labs will probably take years to create market disruption at all. Researchers are not good entrepreneurs, might I add - researchers are obstinate. The current state of academia - redundant research papers, unnecessary complex terminologies for simple methodologies are a testament to the fact. Not all, however, most researchers will defend their methodology to their grave refusing to adapt more pragmatic implementations to their field of study. 

The bottom line is that robots needs to solve problems, experimental ideas such as responsive human robots, organoid computing, dexterous and tactile sensors are groundbreaking but not **sustainable**.  Novel does not mean disruptive, it is easier to design a Roomba to clean a room than to come up with a control strategy for a humanoid to sweep the floor with a broom.

This graph I have made above is not entirely perfect, it is a sliding scale. 
Companies like FinalSpark survive on massive investor money because they dare to challenge the status quo of ethics and science. For such companies revenue or profit is seldom the goal until the technology can add value, solve large problems or automate banal ones - like OpenAI.  

The tipping point investors realizing that the tech you are working on is a golden goose when they get revenue and user feedback (through disruption), this is important to succeed in a free market because institutional investors don't put all their eggs in one basket.
