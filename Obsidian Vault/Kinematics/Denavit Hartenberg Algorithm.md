The Denavit Hartenberg (DH) parameters, AKA the [[Kinematic Parameters]] help establish a relation between the position of the end effector with respect to the fixed frame. The DH parameters help us solve a [[Forward Kinematics]] problem. The DH algorithm is essentially a series of steps that help us assign appropriate coordinate frames to our robot. 

Refer to these handwritten notes for context:

**The following four steps (10 - 13) are steps that give us the DH/Kinematic parameters of a robot.**
