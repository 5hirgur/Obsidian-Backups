**Orthonormal** vectors are a special instance of [[orthogonal]] vectors. In addition to having a $90\degree$angle between them, **orthonormal** vectors each have a magnitude of 1. In particular, the following three conditions must be met for two vectors $u$ and $v$ to be orthonormal :

1. $u.v = 0$
2. $||u|| =1$
3. $||v|| = 1$
