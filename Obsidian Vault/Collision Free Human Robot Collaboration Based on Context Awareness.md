Human robot collaboration, manufacturing systems can allow human operators to work together with robots in the same team without time or space separation. 

Making robots aware of environmental context similarly like human operators.

# Collision Sensing

Track Human operators, Calibrate - enhance image quality use special mapping. OctoMap convert depth sensor data into a 3D occupancy grid. 

# Context Aware

Pose recognition, provides robot with human intent. 

Transfer learning with pose nets, recognizes 17 key body points for accurate posture estimation. 

# Advantages

based on MoveIt! and ROS, is open source. 
Improved the efficiency of the distance based collision free approach.

# Limitations

Heavy computational expense for human pose recognition.

The robustness and responsiveness of pose recognition was not tested in the experiments.
