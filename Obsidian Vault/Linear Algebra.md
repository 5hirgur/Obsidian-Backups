# Linear Algebra for Robotics

In linear algebra we solve a fundamental problem which has n linear equations with n unknowns. 

Robots need to coordinate with multiple different systems together to function optimally. Components like sensors, motors, actuators need to be well synchronized with one another. Linear algebra is a mathematical model used by engineers and mathematicians to achieve this. 

It can be leveraged in [[Basic Coordinate Transformations]] and [[Homogeneous Transformations]]to describe a position and orientation of a robot in it's configuration space, be it mobile or stationary.  In [[Control Theory]], where we are concerned with the behavior of dynamical systems - to design controllers to stabilize a robots behavior, linear algebra is used to model the [[Statistics and Dynamics]] for such a system. Linear algebra is also used in [[machine vision]] where matrices are used to perform various operations for object detection and image segmentation.
