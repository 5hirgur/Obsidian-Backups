The definition of dot product can be given in two ways, i.e. algebraically and geometrically. Algebraically, the dot product is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. Geometrically, it is the product of the two vectorsâ€™ Euclidean magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.

## Algebraic Definition:

The dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n]$ and $\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n]$ is defined as ;
$$\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \cdots + a_n b_n$$
For example, in a 3D space the vectors dot product of vectors $[1,3,-5]$ and $[4,-2,-1]$ is: 
$$\begin{align}
\ [1, 3, -5] \cdot [4, -2, -1] &= (1 \times 4) + (3\times-2) + (-5\times-1) \\
&= 4 - 6 + 5 \\
&= 3
\end{align}$$ If vectors are represented as matrices then they can be written as :\
$$a \cdot b = a^T b$$ expanding on the above example :
$$\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 3 & -5
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  4 \\ -2 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix} = 3 \, $$
## Geometric Definition:

A geometric object possesses both a magnitude and a direction. A vector can be pictured as an arrow. Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction to which the arrow points. Dot product is defined as : 

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}= \left\|\mathbf{a}\right\| \left\|\mathbf{b}\right\|\cos\theta $$

A dot product gives a scalar value.
