# Problem
Soft robotics are safer for working with humans most soft robots are not stiff enough for many applications, need for efficiency in industrial settings .

# Innovation 
Taichi-Mura origami pattern used to make inflatable sleeve of robotic arm. Tube like structure, tendons on either side of the tube to maintain rigidity. Increases rigidity by 300X. Can stably hold objects <250g at 90cm extension

# Applications

- Deployable Robot Arm 
- Rover
  Can fully inflate 29x its volume, deflate within seconds easy to deploy. Carries payload 27X its weight. Ideal for working with humans. 
# Limitations

Slow response poor control and lower payloads/
Solutions might be to add responsive valves and pumps, adaptive control system for slow response/poor control. Hydraulic actuation and use of more rigid materials for  increasing payload capacity.
