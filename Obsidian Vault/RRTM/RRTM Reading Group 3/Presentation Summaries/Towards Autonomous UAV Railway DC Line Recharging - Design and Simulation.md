Autonomous UAV system with onboards PROCESSING
NO PRIOR SOLITION EXISTS FOR AUTONOOUS DC CHARGING THERE HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTATION FOR AC CHARGING THAT NEEDS A SINGLE LANING CONNECTING BOTH LINES AT ONCE

MECHANICAL CONNECTORS FROM THE AC LINE WORK ARE BEING REUSED .

A primary gripper uses a mechanical gripper, which as a servo
The secondary gripper uses a kinetic gripper.

Architecture -  One for sensing and autonomy and one for power line perception.
Flex sensor used for feedback to reorient itself based on the toughness of the line
Thermal characterization during use is used a feedback loop with load dependent control. 

# Experimental Result 

Grippers - succeeded in holding 3220g drone in entirety.
Primary and secondary grippers clasp success.
Automatic cable slack adjustment tested with manual manipulation and calibrated successfully. 

# Experimental Result Circuity 

Test demonstrates the gate switching on the conversion from high voltage rail to 30V using the 5V control voltage. Tested with full range 3kV.

# Paper Conclusion 

Work met outlined goals.

potential improvements:

- real world experimentation exploration.
- electrical shielding.
- gripper failsafe techniques.
