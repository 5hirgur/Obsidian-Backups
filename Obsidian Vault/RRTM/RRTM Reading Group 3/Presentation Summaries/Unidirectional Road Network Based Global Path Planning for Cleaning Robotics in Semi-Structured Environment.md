# Motivation 

Cleaning robots must interact with all stakeholders pedestrians, vehicles etc. safely.

# Proposed Method

A unidirectional road network represents traffic constraints for cleaning robots. 

For complex implementations:
**Hybrid strategy** to be used  - robots can cut across roads at starting and goal points to shorten the path. 
two layer potential map for better handling complex intersections.
