# AI for Navigation
*What can AI do for navigation?*

If we know what a system is trying to achieve, we know the state of the system is - we can feed this data to a planner which will try different actions to help a robot navigate the environment. Planning is a feedback tool that is extremely reliable in understanding the basic model of the system as opposed to reinforcement learning which has to learn from experimentation. Planners have their limitations, they need to be tuned to weather conditions and other external phenomenon.

*Can AI help or replace optimization based planners?*
Using planners or AI on their own is a very suboptimal approach for machine navigation, the are benefits that both these methodologies can offer in tandem is far greater than what they can do individually, there needs to be a subtle balance between how these two are integrated in a robotic navigational system.  
# Semi Autonomy

There is a need to design intelligent machines to work with humans. There are levels of autonomy a robotic system can have and a variety of interfaces that can be designed to handle a whole host of workload and training paradigms. A robot performs task like clockwork and occasionally requires human intervention to transition states or begin a more complex task. 

# Traffic Patterns

 Designing and optimizing patterns for large multi vehicle throughput, search, reliability, real environments and realistic computation. 
 How to design a planning algorithms for real world maps and environments?
 Automate it, automating this is very difficult. 
 Reliability means maximizing the probability of finishing the task, no need to wait for one machine/drone to schedule the next one etc. \

# Indoor Drone Skills

Drones have trouble navigating indoors because it cant see the walls, moving past a plain white wall cannot facilitate visual odometery.
