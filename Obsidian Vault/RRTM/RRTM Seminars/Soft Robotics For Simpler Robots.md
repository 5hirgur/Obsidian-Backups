## Why soft robotics

## Brainless behavior in nature
Leaves tracking the sun to maximize photosynthesis
A bush baby demonstrates extraordinary jumping power through its muscle tendon complex allowing faster release of energy than outputted. Energy is amplified.
Dead fish reacting to a current.

## Reflex response in soft robotics

Development of reflexive soft robotics with smarter materials.
Think about actuation, control, sensing and energy source. 

PhD students designed soft grippers that grab an object when it touches the gripper surface.
