Two vectors $u$ and $v$ are considered to be **orthogonal** when the angle between them is $90\degree$. In other words, orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other. Orthogonality is denoted by $u \perp v$  

A set of vectors $S = \{v_1,v_2,v_3 .... v_n\}$ is mutually orthogonal if every vector in the set is perpendicular to each other. 

Additionally, $v.u = 0$
